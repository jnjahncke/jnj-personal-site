Finding the area under one curve involves taking the integral of that curve over the interval of interest: `\(\int_{a}^{b}{f(x)dx}\)`. 

If you want to find the area between two curves ($f(x)$ and `\(g(x)\)`), you start by taking the integral of the top curve and subtract from that the un-wanted area - the area under the bottom curve. One more step: find where the two curves intersect. That will give you the bounds to use for the integral ($a$ and `\(b\)`).
