<p>Finding the area under one curve involves taking the integral of that curve over the interval of interest: <span class="math inline">\(\int_{a}^{b}{f(x)dx}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to find the area between two curves (<span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>), you start by taking the integral of the top curve and subtract from that the un-wanted area - the area under the bottom curve. One more step: find where the two curves intersect. That will give you the bounds to use for the integral (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>).</p>
