It is a structure that sits at the base of the brain and has long been known to be important for smooth body movements but has more recently been recognized as important for cognition and emotion. Cerebellar cortex is made up of large Purkinje neurons and small basket and stellate cells. Together, these cells form a sterotyped circuit that is repeated throughout the structure.</p> """
