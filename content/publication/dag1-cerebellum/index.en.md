abstract: 'Dystroglycan is a cell adhesion molecule that localizes to synapses throughout the nervous system. While *Dystroglycan* is required to maintain inhibitory synapses from cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) onto Purkinje cells (PCs) whether initial synaptogenesis during development is dependent on Dystroglycan has not been examined. We show that mice with conditional deletion of Dystroglycan from Purkinje cells prior to synaptogenesis results in impaired MLI:PC synapse formation and function due to reduced presynaptic inputs and abnormal postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering. Using genetic manipulations that disrupt glycosylation of Dystroglycan or truncate its cytoplasmic domain, we show that Dystroglycanâ€™s role in synapse function requires both extracellular and intracellular interactions, whereas synapse formation requires only extracellular interactions. Together, these findings provide molecular insight into the mechanism of inhibitory synapse formation and maintenance in cerebellar cortex.'
