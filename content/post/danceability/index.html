<h3>The Visualization: How has the danceability of music changed over time?</h3>
<p><img src="/post/danceability/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>Here, color indicates how “danceable” music was for a given year. Immediately, we can tell that the ’80s and ’90s were the most danceable decades and that 1961 must have been pretty dark days for music.</p>

<h3>The Details: How the Plot was Made</h3>
<p>This ridgeline plot was made using the <code>ggridges</code> package, which integrates with ggplot. (For more information on the ridgeline plot, <a href="/project/the-ridgeline-plot/">see my post</a>.) Here, I used <code>geom_density_ridges()</code> and faceted by decade. The color gradient is the “inferno” palette from <code>viridis</code>. The theme is <code>ggplot:theme_minimal()</code> with some modifications to the background and facet titles.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(track_data, aes(x = danceability, y = year, fill = YearDanceability)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 4, alpha = 0.9) + 
  facet_wrap(~ decade, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, nrow = 1) + # Need free_y scale otherwise the plots aren&#39;t aligned
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0,0, 4)) + # The facet labels were covering the top curve so I added padding
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = &quot;off&quot;) + # to avoid clipping of the top bit of the top curve
  scale_fill_viridis(option = &quot;inferno&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(fill = &quot;Mean Year\nDanceability\nScore&quot;,
       title = &quot;1980&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s: The Most Danceable Decades?&quot;,
       subtitle = &#39;How does the &quot;danceability&quot; of music change over time?&#39;,
       x = &quot;Song Danceability Score&quot;,
       y = &quot;Year&quot;) +
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(color = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgray&quot;), # Format the facet labels
        axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 0.35)) # Change the justification of the y-axis label</code></pre>
